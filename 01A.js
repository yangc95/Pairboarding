// Write a method, digital_root(num). 
// It should sum the digits of a positive integer. 
// If it is greater than or equal to 10, sum the digits of the resulting number. 
// Keep repeating until there is only one digit in the result, called the "digital root". 
// Do not use string conversion within your method.

// caesar_cipher
// Write a function that takes a message and an increment amount and outputs the same letters shifted by that amount in the alphabet. 
// Assume lowercase and no punctuation. Preserve spaces.

// Write a function, longest_common_substring(str1, str2) that takes two strings and returns the longest common substring. 
// A substring is defined as any consecutive slice of letters from another string.
// Bonus: solve it in O(m * n) using O(m * n) extra space. (Hint: the solution involves dynamic programming which will be introduced later in the course.)

// sum_rec
// Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns their sum. Use recursion.
